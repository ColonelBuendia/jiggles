# jiggles

Jiggles The Linux Mouse Jiggler, because you know if you actually turn off sleep via `xset` you won't remember to turn it back on.  

Six lines of shell, and `yad` for all your linux mouse jiggling needs.  Left click or middle click on the mouse icon in your tray to kill jiggles when his work is through.  


## Install

- Copy the script jiggles into your path somewhere. If you aren't sure where that should be, `/usr/local/bin` will do just fine.  
- I have the mouse in `~/icons/jiggles.png` for the purposes of the script, if you don't change it, that's where he lives now.  
- Set the path to the mouse icon in the .desktop file as well to make the icon work, and place that into `~/.local/share/applications`
- Run jiggles however it is you run apps.  


Mouse icon is from Microsoft's Emoji set, by way of the good people at emojipedia.
